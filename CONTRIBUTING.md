## Questions or Issues
If you have a general question or an issue please refer to our FAQ which we'll update reguarly with questions. If you can't find an answer to your question please open an [issue](https://github.com/washingtonpost/ArcAds/issues).

## Testing
ArcAds has a series of unit tests built with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). We are always looking to improve our testing coverage , and request that if you create new functionality that you also include tests along with it.

## Submitting changes
Please send a [Pull Request to ArcAds](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done changed (you read more about [pull requests here](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
Please follow best practices guide below and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Best Practices

  * ArcAds gets linted with the [airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
  * Code should be documented and commented using the [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/) conventions.
  * Please make sure you've tested your code prior to submitting a pull request and ensure everything works.
